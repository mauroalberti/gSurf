# gSurf

This is the developement version, named "profiles", of the gSurf tool.
This version is devoted to the creation of topographic and geological profiles.

To launch it, from the local *gSurf_profiles.py* folder, launch the file as a Python 3 module, e.g.:
 ```bash
python3 -m gSurf_profiles
 ```

Currently it is in a very preliminar stage (branch started 2019-09-29).
