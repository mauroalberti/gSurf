# gSurf

This is the developement version, named "profiles", of the gSurf tool.
This version is devoted to the creation of topographic and geological profiles.

### Requirements
It depends on the **dev** version of pygsf, available at:
https://github.com/mauroalberti/gsf
  
Afterwards, from the folder where the gSurf_profiles.py file is located, launch the tool as a Python 3 module:
 ```bash
python3 -m gSurf_profiles
 ```

### Status

Currently it is in an alpha stage (branch started 2019-09-29).
